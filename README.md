# Caffeine Labeling Project

## Overview

This project investigates the failure of major beverage manufacturers and chain cafes to label caffeinated beverages properly. The lack of accurate caffeine content labeling poses significant health risks, especially for individuals with pre-existing conditions. This repository contains the data, code, and methodology used to develop an interactive data journalism story on this critical issue.

## Background

Major beverage manufacturers and chain cafes often fail to label caffeinated beverages, particularly those that are not coffee, leading to potential health risks and even fatalities. This project aims to shed light on this issue, provide evidence of labeling gaps, and advocate for stricter labeling laws.

## Data Sources

- **Nutrition Facts:** Scraped from a food safety watchdog database, which include nutrition facts of more than 600 beverages.
- **Regulatory Documents:** FDA regulations on caffeine labeling standards.
- **Legal Cases:** Lawsuits related to caffeine overdose, such as Katz v. Panera Bread.

## Data Cleaning, Organization and Visualization

The collected data was cleaned and standardized to ensure consistency and accuracy. This process involved:
- Standardizing caffeine content information for comparison. The standardized information provided a more straightforward way for readers to understand caffeine content in drinks.
- Verifying data accuracy through multiple sources.
- Handling missing data and inconsistencies.

## Methodology

### Development of the Story
- **Initial Research:** Identified the issue through news articles and public health reports.
- **Data Collection:** Gathered data from watchdogs and regulatory bodies.
- **Analysis:** Evaluated the prevalence of unlabelled caffeinated drinks and their health risks.
- **Visualization:** Develope interactive elements for readers to learn the potential risk of high caffeine intake.

### Challenges Faced
- **Data Availability:** Obtaining complete and accurate data was challenging as not all manufacturers disclose caffeine content.
- **Technical Hurdles:** Developing a scraper to handle dynamic web content and varying data formats.
- **Regulatory Complexity:** Understanding and comparing international regulations.

### Potential Improvements
- **Enhanced Data Collection:** Collaborate with labs for independent caffeine content testing.
- **Broader Scope:** Include more beverage types and supplements.
- **Advanced Analysis:** Conduct detailed statistical analysis on health impacts.
