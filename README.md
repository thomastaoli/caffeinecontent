# Caffeine Labeling Project

## Overview

This project investigates the failure of major beverage manufacturers and chain cafes to label caffeinated beverages properly. The lack of accurate caffeine content labeling poses significant health risks, especially for individuals with pre-existing conditions. This repository contains the data, code, and methodology used to develop an interactive data journalism story on this critical issue.

## Background

Major beverage manufacturers and chain cafes often fail to label caffeinated beverages, particularly those that are not coffee, leading to potential health risks and even fatalities. This project aims to shed light on this issue, provide evidence of labeling gaps, and advocate for stricter labeling laws.

## Data Sources

- **Nutrition Facts:** Collected from major cafes and fast-food restaurants.
- **Public Health Records:** Data on caffeine-related health incidents.
- **Regulatory Documents:** FDA regulations and international caffeine labeling standards.
- **Legal Cases:** Lawsuits related to caffeine overdose, such as Katz v. Panera Bread.

## Data Cleaning and Organization

The collected data was cleaned and standardized to ensure consistency and accuracy. This process involved:
- Standardizing caffeine content information for comparison.
- Verifying data accuracy through multiple sources.
- Handling missing data and inconsistencies.

## Code and Functionality

### Highlighted Functionality
One of the critical components of this project is the web scraper developed to automate the collection of caffeine content data from various online sources. The scraper handles dynamic content loading and extracts relevant information efficiently.
## Methodology

### Development of the Story
- **Initial Research:** Identified the issue through news articles and public health reports.
- **Data Collection:** Gathered data from manufacturers and regulatory bodies.
- **Analysis:** Evaluated the prevalence of unlabelled caffeinated drinks and their health risks.

### Challenges Faced
- **Data Availability:** Obtaining complete and accurate data was challenging as not all manufacturers disclose caffeine content.
- **Technical Hurdles:** Developing a scraper to handle dynamic web content and varying data formats.
- **Regulatory Complexity:** Understanding and comparing international regulations.

### Potential Improvements
- **Enhanced Data Collection:** Collaborate with labs for independent caffeine content testing.
- **Broader Scope:** Include more beverage types and supplements.
- **Advanced Analysis:** Conduct detailed statistical analysis on health impacts.
